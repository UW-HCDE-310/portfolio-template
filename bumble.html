              As a personal project (I have no affiliation with Bumble), I scoped
              research questions, designed and ran ten user interviews, and analyzed the data
              in order to understand how women in
              their 20s make friends 1:1 and in group settings and a explore a
              hypothetical group activity feature.

              <!-- <p>those that benefited the project, things the designers
                could not have guessed, anticipated or psychically stumbled upon</p>-->
              <p>People make friends through a variety of methods -
                very intentionally looking to meet people interested in new friendships,
                being befriended by someone else who seemed very intentional,
                or "just becoming" friends without really knowing how it happened.
                Most users talked about more than one method, but a few said most
                of their friendships were from someone else befriending them.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="proj-sub-section-header">What does and does not work well when making friends?</div>
            <div class="proj-section-content">
              <p>Participants talked about how natural it can feel to make friends
                who are friends of their friends. All ten participants talked
                about wondering if another person was interested in being their friend.
              </p>
              <p>Participants said Bumble allows them to screen people quickly
                to find possible friends with similar interests who don't seem creepy.
                Participants in Seattle also talked about feeling like they had
                unlimited options because they could meet a lot of people quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bumble users talked about knowing that everyone on Bumble BFF
                is open to making friends, but being unsure if people were interested
                in being <em>their</em> friend. That feeling was sometimes exacerbated
                if they got many matches but few messages, and again if they had
                many conversations but few invites to meet up in person. Most Bumble
                users reported feeling like they always had to message first and
                they always had to invite people to meet up, otherwise nothing would ever happen.

              <!-- One participant explained that she couldn't invite people to meet up in person because she
              was new to the city and didn't know what coffee shops were good or what fun events were happening.  -->
              <p>Speaking of activities - while most participants brought up concerns about
                suggesting an activity (whether the other person was interested),
                no participants volunteered concerns about what kind of activitiy would work well.
                However, when read hypothetical scenarios, people began expressing
                strong opinons about what kinds of activities would be both engaging
                and leave room for conversation - and not everyone agreed. People
                were split on whether they'd be interested in meeting other people
                who spoke the same second language and on whether they'd like to meet
                people who also liked their favorite cuisine. Most participants agreed
                that they'd enjoy meeting up for a niche hobby like kayaking, and
                expressed interest in finding people to do hobbies with, even if they
                didn't become friends.
                <!-- backgrounds or hobbies would be deep enough for them to want to meet someone, and  -->

            <div class="proj-sub-section-header">How would group meetups be different from 1:1 hangouts?</div>
            <div class="proj-section-content">
              <p>Several of the participants who were introverted or reported having social anxiety
                said that ideally they would build friendships exclusively through 1:1s.
                Other participants wanted to meet in a group setting first, and then meet 1:1.
                Some preferred to meet 1:1 first, and then meet in group settings,
                before eventually meeting 1:1 again in order to go from being a friend to a close friend.
                No matter which camp, people eventually circled back to 1:1s, and
                several participants articulated that is because people are more
                vulnerable and grow closer in 1:1 settings; you don't become
                best friends in a group setting.
              </p>
              <p>Some participants talked about how it can be difficult to build
                a friend group because people need to meet each other early on,
                otherwise some people feel closer with others and the friend circle
                can feel imbalanced. But on the other hand, if you connect people too
                early, then people feel like they don't have a close friendship
                because they're spread too thin.
              </p>
              <p>All participants said they'd be more likely to cancel on a
                group meetup than a 1:1 hangout because a) they wouldn't be inconveniencing anyone
                because the rest of the group could still meet and b) because larger
                social events take more energy.</p>

              <p>
                Bumble might try to help get the ball rolling and asuade people's
                concerns by asking one or both participants if they're interested in meeting up in person,
                or jumping in with suggestions to both people in the chat. One participant
                talked about a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/hinge-rolls-out-new-we-met-feature/">feature
                  on the dating app Hinge</a> where you're asked a) if you went on a date
                and b) if your date is the type of person you'd like to see again.
                She wished Bumble would ask questions like that if the conversation was dragging on:
                "Hi Naomi, we noticed you've been chatting with Sarah for about two weeks. Are you interested in meeting them?"
                And if the user selected "Yes", Bumble could suggest a few kinds of activities.
