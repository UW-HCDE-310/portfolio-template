						<p>Japanese Dictionary and Flashcards</p>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>This website is a fully-functioning Japanese-English dictionary that allows users to add any word they look up into flashcard decks. I worked with a team of three software engineers to start with low-fidelity sketches and do iterative usability tests as we developed the website.</p>
						<p>Timeline: May-August 2019</p>

						<h3>Project</h3>
						<!-- <p>Learning a new language involves looking up new words in a dictionary--- but sometimes students find themselves looking up the same word again and again if they do not learn it. This is particularly difficult for students learning Japanese. In addition to understanding the english meaning of a given word, they will need to learn the pronunciation of the word (written in either hiragana or katakana) as well as the written kanji (symbols that represent the meaning of the word, not the pronunciation).</p> -->
						<p>My team and I created a website that is a Japanese dictionary 
						<!-- (complete with xyz thousand entries from the <a href="http://edrdg.org/jmdict/edict.html">EDICT</a> files from the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group at Monash University) -->
						, that allows users to login to create flashcard decks, practice the flashcards, and record whether they knew the answer or not. 
						We wrote a <a href="images/jdict/proposal.pdf">project proposal</a> that summarizes the requirements, technologies, compares similar apps, and shows the user interface. I created a functioning <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/2160138f-f0bb-43da-582e-bb91bdd270b8-5751/">prototype </a> with AdobeXd to showcase the user experience. Unfortunately, our AWS machine has expired and needs to be set up again, but our code is available on <a href="https://github.com/naomi789/2019_4640">GitHub</a>.
						</p>
						<p>For this project, I wrote Python scripts that converted the JSON files into MySQL statements (meta programing) to fill our databases. I learned not everyone uses UTF-8, and I spent a long time working to get all the different coding languages to use Japanese successfully. I designed the flashcard functionality, my collaborator added the ability to sign up/login, and we collaborated on the dictionary functionality.</p>
						</p>
						<h3>User Studies</h3>
						<p> I created user personas, designed user scenarios, created wireframes, and made a functional prototype with AdobeXd. As features became functional on our live site, I designed qualitative user studies, ran them, and analyzed data. Even as we finished the final product, we were gathering data and creating action items that could improve the quality and usability of our site.

						<h3>Acomplishments</h3>
<!-- 						<p>
						We created a fully functional relational database with nine tables that had a combined total of 1.25 million entries, eleven thousand kanji, and tens of thousands of words, some of which had over ten different definitions. I earned an "A" on this project and in this course, as did my collaborator.
						</p> -->
						<p>In addition to writing the code and running the user studies, there are several other features in development. My collaborator and I created backend features to track whether users got flashcards right and how long they spent thinking about it, but we have not yet created an algorithm to determine how often users should be quizzed on their vocabulary words, how much they should be rewarded for immediately getting an answer correct, or how many times they need to get it right before we can take the word off the rotation for a while. We hope to create a front end that will display some of this data, as well as  statistics about how many words they are studying per day.
