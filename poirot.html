				<h3>Project</h3>
				<p>
				<!-- Designers design interfaces and coders code interfaces. But when these jobs intersect, sometimes coders need to interstand design and designers need to understand code.  -->
				During a formative investigation consisting of interviews, a survey, and an analysis of professional design documents, we explored the issues designers face as they interact with developers and developer tools. We found that many designers were more comfortable with graphical interfaces than they were with Chrome DevTools and other web inspectors. </p>
				<p>My collaborators developed Poirot, a web inspection tool for designers that enables designers to make style edits with buttons and drop down menus instead of editing CSS attributes. The screeshot shows the tool being used to edit the CHI '19 website. 
				</p>
				<h3>Acomplishments</h3>
				<p>I read over 50 research papers and wrote the background research section of our paper. I observed and took notes at a user study.
				</p>
				<h3>Results</h3>


				<p>My collaborators compared Poirot to Chrome DevTools in a lab study with 16 design professionals. We observed common problems designers experience when using Chrome DevTools and found that when using Poirot, designers were more successful in accomplishing typical design tasks (97% to 63%). In addition, we found that Poirot had a significantly lower perceived cognitive load and was overwhelmingly preferred by the designers in our study.</p>
