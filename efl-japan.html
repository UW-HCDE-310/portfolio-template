                I interviewed three native Japanese speakers to understand the difficulties they faced in the classroom, using apps, and with the English language.

              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>Many foreign language learning systems focus on vocabulary memorization through brute-force repetition. While memorization is an important tool and it is important for students to expand their vocabulary, it is more important that students are able to create new sentences themself. Translation based curriculum (e.g., dragging words into the correct order or typing a full sentence on Duolingo) has the same drawback.

                <p>User interviews with native Japanese speakers (n = 3) about their successful and unsuccessful study habits and how they would or would not use artificial intelligence to practice speaking and writing. </p>

              <div class="proj-sub-section-header">"The nail that sticks out gets hammered down"</div>
                  <p>All participants expressed initially feeling ashamed or worried to make mistakes while speaking in English in a classroom for fear of inconveniencing their teacher or peers. One participant described her concern decreasing as she learned about the importance of practice and that mistakes were a natural part of the process.

              <div class="proj-section-content">
                <p>All three participants shared memories of siting in a classroom with 40 other students, listening to a recording of a native English speaker and reading along in their textbook, but reported that they found that kind of teaching decreased their interest in English, decreased their self-efficacy, and did not help them learn to use English on their own.</p>

                <p>All participants were interested in the idea of using a chatbot as a conversation partner or language tutor, and the least proficient English speaker said that would be better for her than a human tutor because she would not be invonveniencing a human teacher with too many questions or frequent but short lessons.</p>
