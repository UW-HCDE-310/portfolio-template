						<h2>Mentor</h2>
						<p>For Microsoft Employees</p>
					</header>
					<div class="box">
						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>The Microsoft <a href="aka.ms/mentor">Mentor</a> program was struggling to help new users find mentors. I ran usability tests and quantiative surveys; analyzed the data, and created 10 actionable tasks to improve our search and database interface. Four of my 10 recommendations were implemented during the 2020 Hackathon.</p>
			<!-- 		<h3>Project</h3>
						<p><a href="aka.ms/mentor">//Mentor</a> allows users to search a database of Microsoft employees and request mentorship. Users can edit the profile, accept or reject mentoring requests, and access a blog full of advice on being both a mentor and a mentee.</p> -->
						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>The goal of Mentor is to help Microsoft employees find mentors. Stakeholders include mentee candidates, mentor candidates, software engineers, and PMs. I determined that the essential tasks for users were the ability to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Input/edit personal data</li>
							<li>Search, select, and request mentorship</li>
							<li>Accept or reject a mentorship role</li>
							<li>Find information about becoming a better mentor/mentee</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Research: surveys</h3>
						<p>I ran a survey to identify what factors recent college grads at Microsoft considered when searching for new mentors. I found that 72% of participants were most interested in finding a career mentor and 89% of partcipants were most interested in a traditional mentor.</p>
						<p>There was less of a consensus when asked to report what factors were the top five for them when picking a mentor: 79% said the mentor's career path, 72% said the mentor's experience, 65% said whether they "clicked" with the mentor, 62% said the mentor's personality, 49% said the mentor's enthusiasm for mentoring. Except for the category "other", which only received one vote, the remaining eight categories all recieved five or more votes.</p>

						<a class="image fit"><img src="images/mentor/consider.png" alt=""></a>
						<p></p>
						<!-- <ul>
							<li>72% of participants were most interested in finding a career mentor (three participants were most interested in receiving mentoring for hard skills; two for hard skills; one for Microsoft-specific guidance; one for life mentoring; one for "other mentoring").</li>
							<li>89% of partcipants were most interested in a traditional mentor (two participants were looking for a peer mentor; two reported having no preference; no participants expressed interest in receiving mentorship from someone younger).</li>
							<li>When asked to select their top five factors of consideration when picking a mentor, 79% said the mentor's career path, 72% said the mentor's experience, 65% said whether they "clicked" with the mentor, 62% said the mentor's personality, 49% said the mentor's enthusiasm for mentoring. Except for the category "other", which only received one vote, the remaining eight categories all recieved five or more votes.</li>
						</ul> -->
						<h3>Research: usability testing</h3>
						<p>I ran six 30-minute usability studies where I asked users:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Summarize previous mentoring experience; outline ideal mentoring experience</li>
							<li>What they would look for in a mentor; to search for a mentor</li>
							<li>To select a mentor; how they would like to select a mentor</li>
							<li>To update their profile; what data they wanted to see about possible mentors or mentees</li>
							<li>To accept a mentoring request from me; what factors they would consider before accepting a request</li>
							<li>What they would like to see on the website; where it would be and how it would work</li>
						</ul>
						<p>After gathering the data, I analyzed it and made a 30 minute presentation to my fellow hackers. I began by showing a four minute clip of a user trying 14 different queries and getting no results each time. The user got so frustrated with the search interface that he angrily declared "If you weren't here watching me, I would have left the site by now. I'm not getting any search results, and now I feel like mentor is not for me!"</p>
						<p>After presenting my key findings, I drew up four short term solutions that could be implemented that day to improve the learnability and decrease the risk fatal of errors. I then began drafting long-term solutions that could improve the learnability and satisfaction. 	
						</p>
						<h3>Acomplishments</h3>
						<p>Three of the four changes I recommended for immediate implemention have been completed; I will be running further usability testing before we implement the new email notification templates. I've joined the year round team that works on this tool so that I can help as we discuss solutions that are beyond the scope of a three day hackathon.</p>
