					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>Novice designers are often able to recognize good design but struggle to create it, so we created a GUI-based web development tool that generates design suggestions. I ran five card sorting studies and 10 usability studies. We created a development plan and implemented 15 improvements.</p>
					<p>Timeline: June-August 2017</p>
					<p>Team: Nigel Chen, Renata Drucker, Kesler Tanner (Ph.D. candidate), and Dr. James Landay (professor)</p>

					<h3>The question</h3>
					<p>Websites have become ubiquitous and there is a multitude of ways for novices to create their own site. However, novices usually start from a template. If they make a change that looks bad, some novices begin changing more and more details in hopes that they can make their design look good again, but this can spiral into a poorly designed website. Other users notice when they make a bad change, and revert it--- but if they continue to do this, their final product can end up being very similar to the original template they started with. </p>
					<p>How can we help novice designers create better websites? </p>
					</p>
					<h3>Background research</h3>
					<p>According to research done by my collaborators, "Design novices have limited design experience and typically lack the skills or confidence to create good design..." but that novices are able to recognize good design "...almost as well as experts (76.5% accuracy compared to 81.2%)."<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-97082-0_13">("I know It When I See It: How Experts and Novices Recognize Good Design"</a>, Tanner and Landay 2018).
					<h3>Ideation & iteration</h3>
					<p>My collaborators and I coded a user interface that lets web designers compare multiple possibilities before selecting one. Instead of selecting a color or font from a list of a dozen of options, the right half of this interface shows five or six miniature versions of their website, so they can see how their site would look with the change.
					</p>
					<p>I learned about card sorting and tree testing as I collaborated with two other interns to plan and implement the menu. I ran one-on-one user studies. I researched buttons, fonts, and colors in order to design algorithms to suggest design pairings.
					</p>
					<h3>Final solution</h3>

					<h3>Outcome and impact</h3>
					<p>We were able to complete the deliverables by the end of the summer internship. Through user studies, we found that users did not need a guide to use the interface and they users were able to create designs that were different from their peers' creations.</p>
